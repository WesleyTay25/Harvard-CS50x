I have used:
<html>
<button>
<form>
<script>
<body>
<footer>
<header>
<a>
<p>
<input>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<h1>
<h2>
<h3>

header
h3
h2
h1
p

I used bootstrap to implement a NavBar on the top and to ensure that my html elements are able to responsive to changes in display size
I used JavaScript to implement a button function to alternate between images when clicked and also an form to receive email input from users
