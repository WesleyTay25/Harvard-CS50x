# Harvard-CS50x
Hello! This repository showcases my learning journey in Harvard's CS50x Course by David Malan.
I started Harvard CS50x Course 2025 on 9th March 2025 and have completed the course and received my certificate.

Throughout my journey with CS50x, I have been exposed to many topics and have completed problem sets respectively:
- Week 0: Scratch
- Week 1: C
- Week 2: Arrays
- Week 3: Algorithms
- Week 4: Memory
- Week 5: Data Structures
- Week 6: Python
- Week 7: SQL
- Week 8: HTML/CSS/JS
- Week 9: Flask
- Week 10: Final Project: BuiltDaily

A few noticeable problems include 
- Week 5 Speller, where I created a hashtable of linkedlists to optimize time complexity in a program that checks that a paragraph is spelled correctly using a dictionary of 140000 words.
- Week 9 Finance, where I created a stock broker that fetches real-time prices from an API key, allows you to purchase and sell stocks and showcases your stock portfolio along with a history of past transactions using SQLite database in addition to a login/register/logout function and hosted it server-side using Flask framework.
- Week 10 Final Project: BuiltDaily (Completed as of 20th April 2025) A fitness app that helps track workouts, calories burned, and nutritional intake. Check it out on my other repository "Harvard-CS50X-Final-Project"

Through this course, I was able to obtain a solid foundation of Computer Science and Programming. Using this course as a stepping stone, I have enrolled in CS50w and CS50AI courses and completing them now. Check it out on my other repositories!
